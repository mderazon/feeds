Covered terrace with BBQ/ outside kitchen.\nIn the main house there is a large open plan kitchen/ dining/ living area with woodburner and terrace doors to front garden and the pool at the rear; bathroom; garage which has been converted into a bedroom.\nThe orientation is such that the property – and pool – has all day sunshine. Solar water heating and pre-installation for a/c.\n\nLocated between the beaches of Arrifana and Monte Clerigo, with a significant historical ‘point’ , Atalia, where there are incredible views of this stunning coastline. The urbanisation has been in development for over 30 years resulting in a wide variety of styles and ages of houses. Currently it is not permitted to build even though there are many vacant plots. The amenities are two small supermarkets, a bakery, several restaurants and cafes, many surf schools/ lodges.\nThe main town of Aljezur is just a 10 minute drive, it can also be reached by a regular bus service.\n\">\n    <div itemprop=\"offers\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Offer\">\n        <meta itemprop=\"priceCurrency\" content=\"EUR\">\n        <meta itemprop=\"price\" content=\"680000\">\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"prop\">\n    <a class=\"prop__link\" href=\"/property-for-sale/villa-aljezur-ref_c3834/23624\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    <div class=\"prop__img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://cdn.proppy.app/propertyphotos/43/2fbd51c5-f2e4-4672-b227-982b33e51e2c/23624/efa3482f-a9b9-4003-9c9d-4cd281d28b72.jpg?quality=80&amp;width=650&amp;height=448&amp;mode=crop);\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"Photo\"></div>\n    <div class=\"prop__panel\">\n        <p class=\"prop__title\">ATTRACTIVE THREE BEDROOM VILLA WITH POOL IN A QUIET LOCATION, VALE DA TELHA</p>\n            <p><span class=\"prop__location\">Aljezur</span> <span class=\"prop__price\"><strong>680.000 €</strong></span></p>\n        <button class=\"fa fa-heart-o js-toggleFavorite\" type=\"button\" data-prop-id=\"23624\" data-action-text=\"REF: C3834\" title=\"Add to favorites\" data-add-title=\"Add to favorites\" data-remove-title=\"Remove from favorites\"></button>\n\n        <p><span class=\"prop__reference\">Ref: C3834</span></p>\n    </div>\n</div>","link":"https://www.marcelapropriedades.com/property-for-sale/villa-aljezur-ref_c3834/23624","retrieved":1692812249860},{"title":"","contents":"<div itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Product\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"brand\" content=\"Marcela Propriedades Lagos\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"REBUILT RURAL COTTAGE WITH 2 RUINS IN AN IDYLLIC PEACEFUL LOCATION, ODECEIXE\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"image\" content=\"https://cdn.proppy.app/propertyphotos/43/2fbd51c5-f2e4-4672-b227-982b33e51e2c/23520/07f511f2-238d-4f98-ab25-3158b359595b.jpg?quality=70&amp;width=650&amp;height=448&amp;mode=crop\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"description\" content=\"A small T1 + 1 charming rural cottage with two ruins to restore/ rebuild located on a 76.750m2 plot of land in an idyllic peaceful location nestled in the hillside with wonderful countryside views and all day sunshine.\nThe restored 79m2 cottage has an open plan kitchen/ living room with ‘basic’ kitchen and fireplace/ salamander; bathroom; bedroom with mezzanine and terrace doors to the front of the property. Separate room (outside access) for storage/ office. Wooden doors and windows (in need of maintenance); insulated roof.\nVery nearby is the largest of the two ruins with 3 divisions of 146m2 which would need to be completely rebuilt as would the smaller of the ruins, located on the boundary of the land (a short walk from the other properties) this being 24m2; perfect for storage of garden equipment or as a studio.\nBuilt before 1951 the construction of all the properties is ‘Taipa’ (natural materials).\nAccess by a dirt track (4WD not necessary); 20 minutes drive to the nearest towns of Odeceixe and Rogil and a further 5 minutes to Aljezur. Odeceixe has one of the most beautiful beaches on the Western Algarve.\nMains electricity, water from a stream and springs. Drainage installed for a fossa.\nBeautiful old trees on the land – pine, cork, medronha, nespraha, quince &amp; cherry – terraces leading down to a stream. NOTE: the land is very overgrown and needs clearing. Previously there was a vegetable garden and orange grove.\nThis is the perfect location for anyone wanting to get ‘away from it all’ and be at one with nature. A few neighbouring properties but not visible from this location. Having all day sunshine would be perfect for the installation of solar giving the opportunity of being ‘self sufficient’.\nA great project offering real potential to someone with vision and energy!\n\">\n    <div itemprop=\"offers\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Offer\">\n        <meta itemprop=\"priceCurrency\" content=\"EUR\">\n        <meta itemprop=\"price\" content=\"360000\">\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"prop\">\n    <a class=\"prop__link\" href=\"/property-for-sale/villa-aljezur-ref_c3825/23520\"></a>\n\n        <span class=\"prop__stamp\">EXCLUSIVE</span>\n\n\n\n\n\n    <div class=\"prop__img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://cdn.proppy.app/propertyphotos/43/2fbd51c5-f2e4-4672-b227-982b33e51e2c/23520/07f511f2-238d-4f98-ab25-3158b359595b.jpg?quality=80&amp;width=650&amp;height=448&amp;mode=crop);\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"Photo\"></div>\n    <div class=\"prop__panel\">\n        <p class=\"prop__title\">REBUILT RURAL COTTAGE WITH 2 RUINS IN AN IDYLLIC PEACEFUL LOCATION, ODECEIXE</p>\n            <p><span class=\"prop__location\">Aljezur</span> <span class=\"prop__price\"><strong>360.000 €</strong></span></p>\n        <button class=\"fa fa-heart-o js-toggleFavorite\" type=\"button\" data-prop-id=\"23520\" data-action-text=\"REF: C3825\" title=\"Add to favorites\" data-add-title=\"Add to favorites\" data-remove-title=\"Remove from favorites\"></button>\n\n        <p><span class=\"prop__reference\">Ref: C3825</span></p>\n    </div>\n</div>","link":"https://www.marcelapropriedades.com/property-for-sale/villa-aljezur-ref_c3825/23520","retrieved":1692466643282},{"title":"","contents":"<div itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Product\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"brand\" content=\"Marcela Propriedades Lagos\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"MODERN THREE STOREY TWO BED TOWNHOUSE WITH POOL AND OCEAN VIEWS, ESPARTAL\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"image\" content=\"https://cdn.proppy.app/propertyphotos/43/2fbd51c5-f2e4-4672-b227-982b33e51e2c/23469/77bfcaac-64e8-4bb0-88aa-45d25344faeb.jpeg?quality=70&amp;width=650&amp;height=448&amp;mode=crop\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"description\" content=\"An approved project to construct a modern 180m2 three storey two bed townhouse on a 141.34m2 plot with small swimming pool, balconies, terraces and ocean views.
