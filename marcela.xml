    <meta itemprop="description" content="A small T1 + 1 charming rural cottage with two ruins to restore/ rebuild located on a 76.750m2 plot of land in an idyllic peaceful location nestled in the hillside with wonderful countryside views and all day sunshine.
The restored 79m2 cottage has an open plan kitchen/ living room with ‘basic’ kitchen and fireplace/ salamander; bathroom; bedroom with mezzanine and terrace doors to the front of the property. Separate room (outside access) for storage/ office. Wooden doors and windows (in need of maintenance); insulated roof.
Very nearby is the largest of the two ruins with 3 divisions of 146m2 which would need to be completely rebuilt as would the smaller of the ruins, located on the boundary of the land (a short walk from the other properties) this being 24m2; perfect for storage of garden equipment or as a studio.
Built before 1951 the construction of all the properties is ‘Taipa’ (natural materials).
Access by a dirt track (4WD not necessary); 20 minutes drive to the nearest towns of Odeceixe and Rogil and a further 5 minutes to Aljezur. Odeceixe has one of the most beautiful beaches on the Western Algarve.
Mains electricity, water from a stream and springs. Drainage installed for a fossa.
Beautiful old trees on the land – pine, cork, medronha, nespraha, quince &amp; cherry – terraces leading down to a stream. NOTE: the land is very overgrown and needs clearing. Previously there was a vegetable garden and orange grove.
This is the perfect location for anyone wanting to get ‘away from it all’ and be at one with nature. A few neighbouring properties but not visible from this location. Having all day sunshine would be perfect for the installation of solar giving the opportunity of being ‘self sufficient’.
A great project offering real potential to someone with vision and energy!
