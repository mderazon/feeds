    <meta itemprop="description" content="This beautifully situated plot with sea views is just 5 minutes from the famous Arrifana beach and 5 km from the impressive Monte Clerigo beach.

The plot is west-facing in an ideal frontline position. This gives you a marvellous view of the natural surroundings.

There is a bakery and various restaurants within walking distance of the property.

Perfect opportunity for investment. As soon as the building moratorium in Vale da Telha is lifted and construction allowed the value will go up substantially.

About Vale da Telha:

Located between the beaches of Arrifana and Monte Clerigo, with a significant historical ‘point’ , Atalia, where there are incredible views of this stunning coastline. The urbanisation has been in development for over 30 years resulting in a wide variety of styles and ages of houses. Currently it is not permitted to build even though there are many vacant plots. The amenities are two small supermarkets, a bakery, several restaurants and cafes, many surf schools/ lodges.
The main town of Aljezur is just a 10 minute drive, it can also be reached by a regular bus service.

    <meta itemprop="description" content="A 118m2 ruin in the centre of this desirable Portuguese village of Bordeira, with a project submitted to construct a two storey 4 bed house with terrace on the upper level.

The project (yet to be approved with a total construction area of 236m2) comprises of :-

Ground Floor - 4 e/s bedrooms ; utility room and storage
Upper Level - open plan kitchen/ dining area, spacious living room with views across the neighbouring countryside; terrace area with views across the village.

The ruin is attached to a garage (not part of the property) but there are no immediate neighbours other than across the little street where it is located.

The local cafe is conveniently located in front of the ruin. The  stunning local beaches of Amado and Bordeira at Carrapateira are 10 minutes drive away, making this traditional village very popular with visitors and holiday makers, yet it retains its traditional Portuguese identity.

If you're ready to take the next step in realising your dream of owning your own home, contact us to arrange a visit to this property. We're here to answer all your questions and help you make this property your next home.

Located in the Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park, the beaches are endowed with unique fauna and flora. Of particular note are the long stretches of sand and the surrounding landscape of jagged cliffs and dunes. An ideal environment for surfing, with plenty of waves and few surfers.

A unique opportunity to invest in a special house in a very special place.
