The plot is in a very desirable location.
The urbanisation of Espartal is one of the very few communities located within the Western Algarve Natural Park and sought-after for its proximity to two of the most beautiful beaches of the Costa Vicentina: Praia Monte Clerigo and Praia da Amoreira. Both beaches, which are also great surf spots, are within walking distance of the property and connected via a trail along the cliffs.

Supermarkets, medical services, cafes, stores and a weekly farmers market are a few minutes away by car in Aljezur town. A sought-after international school can be reached in about 15 minutes. 
Faro Airport can be reached in just over one hour.
